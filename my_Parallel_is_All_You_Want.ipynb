        "# Parallel is All You Want: Combining Spatial and Temporal Feature Representions of Speech Emotion by Parallelizing CNNs and Transformer-Encoders\n",
        "# Abstract\n",
        "In this notebook, I'm going to build upon my [Intro to Speech Audio Classification repo](https://github.com/IliaZenkov/sklearn-audio-classification) and build two parallel convolutional neural networks (CNN) in parallel with a Transformer encoder network to classify audio data. We're working on the [RAVDESS dataset](https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/) to classify emotions from one of 8 classes. We combine the CNN for spatial feature representation and the Transformer for temporal feature representation. We augment the training data by increasing variation in the dataset to reduce overfitting; we use Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to augment the RAVDESS dataset three-fold for a total of 4320 audio samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "We harness the image-classification and spatial feature representation power of the CNN by treating MFCC plots as grayscale images; their width is a time scale, their height is a frequency scale. The value of each pixel in the MFCC is the intensity of the audio signal at a particular range of mel frequencies at a time step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of the sequential nature of the data, we will also use the Transformer to try and model as accurately as possible the temporal relationships between pitch transitions in emotions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook takes inspirations from a variety of recent advances in deep learning and network architectures; in particular, stacked and parallel CNN networks combined with multi-head self-attention layers from the Transformer Encoder. I hypothesize that the expansion of CNN filter channel dimensions and reduction of feature maps will provide the most expressive feature representation at the lowest computational cost, while the Transformer-Encoder is used with the hypothesis that the network will learn to predict frequency distributions of different emotions according to the global structure of the MFCC plot (and indirectly, mel spectrogram) of each emotion. **With the strength of the CNN in spatial feature representation and Transformer in sequence encoding, I manage to achieve an 80.44% accuracy on a hold-out test set from the RAVDESS dataset.**\n",

        "# Introduction\n",
        "From my previous notebook: \"Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent DNN candidates for audio data classification: LSTM RNNs because of their excellent ability to interpret sequential data such as features of the audio waveform represented as a time series; CNNs because features engineered on audio data such as spectrograms have marked resemblance to images, in which CNNs excel at recognizing and discriminating between distinct patterns.\" - Me\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm going to build on that - CNNs are still the hallmark of image classification today, although even in this domain Transformers are beginning to take the main stage: A [2021 ICLR submission: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy) claims they've implemented a Transformer for image classification that outperforms a state of the art CNN, and at a much lower computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to taking inspiration from the above, it's also no longer 2015 - so instead of the LSTM-RNN I'm going to implement its successor the Transformer model in parallel with a CNN to try and get state-of-the-art performance on the RAVDESS dataset.\n",
        "\n",

        "As a whole, the CNN architecture of this network is inspired by a combination of the golden standards in image and sequence processing over the last few years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each 3-layer deep 2D convolutional block is extremely similar to the **classic [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) architecture: Conv->Pool>Conv>Pool>FC.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**[AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) forms the basis for increasing the complexity of feature maps with channel expansion through stacked CNN layers; [Inception and GoogLeNet](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43022.pdf) are the inspiration for parallelizing CNN layers in the hopes of diverisfying the features learned by the network.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**[VGGNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) proved the unreasonable efficiency of using fixed sized kernels throughout deeply stacked CNN layers;** I found this to extend to this task. Specifically, VGG saw an improvement over AlexNet largely by replacing large kernels (i.e. 11x11 stride 5) with smaller ones of 3x3 stride 1. One of the motivations that VGG cites for this is that the 3x3 kernel is the smallest kernel size choice in understanding spatial data w.r.t. up/down/left/right (although VGG also uses 1x1 kernels). VGGNet also inspires the maxpool kernel size of 2x2 stride 2, as I have used at the first layer of each convolutional block.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be more precise, the motivation to use small stacked filters is two-fold: Computational efficiency and expressivity of feature representation. When we stack 3 3x3 kernels on top of eachother as in this architecture, the second layer has a 5x5 view of the original input volume, and the 3rd layer a 7x7 view. However, the nonlinearities between each smaller layer convey more complex feature representations, whereas a single 7x7 layer would only perform a linear transformation itself. Furthermore, if we keep channel (C) consistent between layers, then 3 3x3 kernels are parameterized by (3(C(3x3xC)) = 27C^2 parameters, while just one 7x7 kernel needs C(7x7xC) = 49C^2 parameters. **Ultimately, small stacked kernels appear to be both more powerful and efficient - although, in [Large Kernel Matters -\n",
        "Improve Semantic Segmentation by Global Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02719.pdf), the authors conclude that a larger kernel outperforms smaller stacked kernels for semantic segmentation - however, since we are just doing the semantic part (classification) and don't care about \"where\" the emotion is - this shouldn't apply.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the original [2015 Batch Normalization (BN) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) suggests that \"We add the BN transform immediately before the nonlinearity\" i.e. before ReLU; however, **I achieved better performance out of this architechture using BN after ReLU. See Keras author's [Francois Chollet's response on GitHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/1802#issuecomment-187966878) regarding the BN order issue: \"I can guarantee that recent code written by Christian \\[Szegedy\\] applies relu before BN\".**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Transformer architecture is precisely as in Viswani et al, 2017: Attention is All You Need, but I use 4 stacked encoders instead of 6 as in their paper. For more details on the Transformer block: [Appendix B: The Transformer and Self-Attention (is All You Need)](#Appendix-B:-The-Transformer-and-Self-Attention-(is-All-You-Need))\n",
        "\n",
        "# CNN Motivation\n",
        "**CNNs with 2D convolutional layers are the gold standard for image processing**, other than the recent advances in the Transformer for images. 2D convolution layers accept input feature maps in a (N,C,H,W) (batch size, channel, height, width) format. We have 4320 MFCC plots - 1440 native and 2880 noise augmented - each MFCC plot is of shape 40x282 with 40 MFC coefficients representing different mel pitch ranges, with 282 timesteps for each MFC coefficient. **We can imagine MFCC plots to be a black and white image with 1 signal intensity channel.** Our MFCC input feature tensor will thus be of shape (4320, 1, 40, 282) before splitting for training. I'm going to refer to input/output feature maps and input/output volumes interchangeably, but they have the same meaning. After an activation function operates on a feature map, it produces an activation map.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm using 3x3 kernels in all 3 layers in both CNN blocks. The first layer only has a single input channel creating a 1x3x3 filter, with 16 output channels necessitating 16 such unique 1x3x3 filters with 1x3x3=9 weights per filter. The next layer has 16 input channels and 32 output channels, producing 32 unique 16x3x3 filters, *each* filter having 16x3x3 = 144 weights. That is, the second layer is applying 32 differently weighted 16x3x3 filters to an input volume of 16x20x141 (the 2x2 maxpooled output of the first layer), producing an output feature map of 32x5x35 after 4x4 stride 4 maxpooling. The last layer has 32 input channels, so a 32x3x3 filter, and 64 output channels, so 64 unique such filters with 32x3x3=288 weights each. The last layer produces an output feature map of 64x1x8 after 4x4 stride 4 maxpooling. **I hope that the simultaneous expansion of filter depth/complexity and reduction of feature map volume will provide the most expressive hierarchical feature representation at the lowest computational cost.**\n",

This made sense to me because emotions colour the entire sequence of frequencies, not just at one timestep.\n",

Both use CNN architectures.

        "# Conclusion\n",
        "---------------\n",
        "Advances of the last 5 years involving upgrades to the autoencoder scheme have lead to the RNN, the upgraded LSTM-RNN, bidirectional LSTM-RNNs, and eventually to LSTM-RNNs with Attention layers to give profound temporal expressivity to the latent space of sequentially encoded data. The Transformer has built on this by taking advantage of parallelized self-attention layers to provide an almost truly global temporal representation of sequential data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, carefully thought out architecture building on these blocks leads to reasonable training times and excellent generalizability. We combine the CNN for spatial feature representation and the Transformer for temporal feature representation, and  augment the training data by increasing variation in the training dataset to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "CNNs are still the standard for encoding representations of spatial data. A CNN's filters' kernel sizes are important to both performance and accuracy, especially considering recent paradigms using smaller maxpool kernels such as those of the 3x3 strided 1 kernels in [VGGNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf), in contrast to the 11x11 stride 4 kernels as in the [AlexNet paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "When we added convolutional and transformer layers beyond what was used here, that actually decreased test accuracy. Only as much complexity is warranted as is needed for generalizability. Although CNNs are good for images and transformers for sequential data, recently emerging paradigms (such as in this notebook) show that these networks are perfectly cross-applicable given careful thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "CNNs are powerful. Transformers work beautifully. They're even better together. Gone are the days of the LSTM-RNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you got this far, I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to do so. Feel free to drop me a line at ilzenkov@gmail.com with any feedback or questions you may have."

        "At the heart of the behaviour of each convoluitional layer is its kernels. Each convolutional layer is made of a certain number of 2D kernels whose dimensions we specify .**A stack of 2D kernels in a layer create the 3D filters defining the operation of that layer on its input feature map (a tensor). Each filter contains a number of weights equal to its size (i.e. depth x height x width).** The kernel's size is a hyperparameter of the convolutional layer; the kernel's receptive field. It is so named because **the kernel's size determines the dimensions of the input feature map it sees during each convoluton.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Even though complete CNN filters are 3D, they are only moved by their stride length in the H x W dimensions and encompass the entire depth of the feature map over which they operate - so the convolution is actually 2D, hence the nomenclature.**\n",

        "When performing a convolution, we take the products of the kernel's weights with the values of the input feature map and sum them to create a single entry in the output feature map. In this task, the initial input feature map has values describing pixel brightness - in our case, **we have 40x282 \"MFCC pixels\", each pixel representing the intensity in decibels of each of 40 MFC coefficients at each of 282 time points - in other words, we have a 40x282 grayscale image map with just one channel for brightness, which is why a CNN is a first-choice model for the task.**  Each kernel constituting a convolutional layer's filter creates a single 2D feature map - and so **more kernels = larger filters = more 2D feature maps = higher complexity (depth) 3D feature maps, where the # of kernels is specified by a layer's input channel.** If our input feature map has 1 channel and 2D dimensions H x W and we want 16 output channels, we'll have 1 2D kernel in that layer's filter and produce 16 2D feature maps of H x W, or a single 3D 16 x H x W feature map for the entire layer. **A higher output channel dimension creates a larger quantity of output feature maps. This may be beneficial or detrimental w.r.t. overfitting depending on the task.**\n",

Each 2D kernel creates a single 2D contribution to each output channel - so the entire 3D filter creates one entire 3D output channel. In this architecture, and as is standard for stacked CNNs, we expand the complexity of the input feature map in the channel/depth dimension while keeping constant its H x W dimensions. Each 3D filter is passed over the input feature map once for every complete output channel. The number of input channels determines the number of 2D kernels and thus, the *size of all 3D filters* in a layer, while the number of output channels determines *how many 3D filters* are passed over the input feature map - the convolution of all input feature maps with unique 3D filter creates one unique output channel.\n",

The idea behind this paradigm is to create higher-order feature representations akin to the way humans recognize images.\n",

If our kernel sizes is > 1 and stride length is > 1, this means we will completely lose features at the right and bottom edge of our feature map. Zero padding is standard in convolutional layers for kernel sizes > 1, even with a stride of 1 - if we don't pad in this case, corner pixels (features) will only be used once. **Because all convolutional kernels in this network are 3x3 stride 1; I zero-pad 1 to preserve the input dimensions of the feature map at each convolutional layer, i.e. 'same' zero-padding.**\n",

        "\n",
        "This is where the real magic happens. Maxpool kernels operate on a feature map much like convolutional kernels; however, they perform no multiplication or addition, but rather a simple argmax operation taking the highest valued feature in the maxpool kernel's receptive field; In this way, maxpool layers reduce the dimensions of the feature maps (volumes) upon which they operate. Maxpooling can be equivalently seen as a dimensionality reduction, or down-sampling technique for features spaces. **Ultimately, maxpooling drastically reduces the numer of parameters a network must learn**; there are much fewer connections between subsequent layers than there would be without maxpooling. **Maxpooling is precisely what makes CNNs practical.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Intuitively, maxpooling outputs a feature map that contains only the most important features in each region of an input feature map, and puts these features in context of their position relative to the other most important features. Here's an extremely suitable analogy not far from what happens under the hood: **An eye near a nose near a mouth probably means a face - doesn't matter the position of the eye, it just matters that it's adjacent to the nose, and the nose to the mouth. Because of this paradigm, CNNs are extremely good at recognizing images even when rotated or shifted: that is, CNNs are feature and scale invariant. Note, however, that features themselves learned by CNNs are *not* scale or rotation invariant.** Again, and perhaps even moreso in this way, maxpooling is the absolute core of a CNN.\n",

This is precisely what we need to get the generalizability we want.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this architecture I use non-overlapping maxpool kernels, reducing an input volume by the kernel size: **Using a 2x2 maxpool kernel takes 1/4 pixels in its receptive field, so it reduces the amount of information contained in its output volume by 75%.** The first layer has a 40x282 input volume = 11,280 pixels; after 2x2 maxpooling this becomes a 20x141 output volume = 2,820 pixels. 2,820/11,280 = 1/4. **While the dimensions of the volume are reduced the *dimensions* of the kernel, the total amount of information in the volume is reduced by the *size* of the kernel.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**The typical maxpool kernel on a first convolutional layer in stacked architecture such as AlexNet and GoogLeNet is 2x2 with stride 1.** A higher stride length throws away more information and a smaller stride length retains more, since they will take less or more steps over the input volume depending on their stride length, less so on their size. Some prominent networks (AlexNet, GoogLeNet) use 3x3 kernels with stride length 2 for their maxpooling layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "I optimized the kernel size and stride on the principal of finding a perfect balance between feature retention at each layer of the network and feature reduction to make the model computationally reasonable. **I found that a 2x2 stride 2 non-overlapping maxpool kernel - a 1/4 feature map reduction - was necessary on the input layer to retain a decent balance of features going through subsequent convolutional layers, but thereafter a non-overlapping 8x8, stride 8 kernel - a 1/16 feature map reduction - provided an excellent computation boost on the next 2 layers with little trade-off in accuracy.**\n",

As in section 5.2 of [the dropout paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580), the **weights learned in training must be scaled by a factor 1/(1-p) so that the weights are not inflated for those activations that are kept; this is necessary so the same network is performant without dropout on test data.** In essence, we keep the sum of the weights the same when using dropout, so we produce the same expected value of activations  independent of dropout probability - otherwise the activations from the kept neurons would cause incorrect weights to be learned. Dropout is applicable to a wide variety of neural net architectures. Think of it as kind of a \"weight loss\" for your network, pun intended - **making not only for faster training, but also reducing the co-dependence between learned features. Note that we turn off dropout (i.e. we keep all learned neurons) during validation and testing.**\n",

Non saturating nonlinearities (such as ReLU) are highly affected by weights of higher magnitude while saturating nonlinearities (sigmoid, tanh) may make a model slower to train. **Because the differential of a saturating nonlinear activation for outputs beyond +-1 approaches 0, the error differential between such outputs also approaches zero, meaning no change to backpropogation for such outputs - i.e. we encounter a variation of the vanishing gradient problem with saturing nonlinear activations.** Batch normalization re-centers the data, making it more likely that activation maps will belong to similar distributions throughout training. More specifically, **batch normalization encourages each layer's neurons to produce outputs closer to the linear regions of their activation**, i.e. attempts to center the activation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As activation map distributions change, the loss surface of the optimizer becomes more volatile; the loss surface is defined for  settings of the weights, which will be updated in unpredictable ways on unstable activation maps. As such, lower learning rates are usually needed to ensure weights are moved in the direction of a more stable negative gradient, otherwise an optimizer is more likely to converge on suboptimal solutions before proper model parameters are learned. **Though input feature maps may be initially scaled to have zero mean and unit variance, once they are output as activations of a subsequent hidden layer different features sets may transform to belong to different distributions.** Proper parameter initialization is also important to consider in avoiding suboptimal convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Batch normalization ultimately results in faster convergence by steering a model away from becoming stuck in a saturated learning regime with a vanishing gradient.** Batch normalization also encourages regularized weights in this way, discouraging exploding gradients and overfitting. This normalization is implemented internally as an aspect of the model's architecture, so the output from each training minibatch is normalized at each layer. Since this mitigates the issue of internal covariate shift, **the network can be initialized with a broader range of parameters and a higher learning rate, and still achieve optimal convergenec.**  \n",
        "\n",
        "The paper shows BN works this empirically instead of with a mathematical proof - which is perhaps why some disagree with the reasoning behind BN: In [How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?,](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11604.pdf) the authors argue that the stabilziation of the internal covariate shift is not the main factor behind BN's success, but rather **it is smoothing of the optimizer's loss function landscape that improves performance**. A smoother loss surface creates a more stable direction of the gradient differential between each training step i.e. moving towards a good minima; te gradients are more predictable leading to faster training since we can use higher learning rates when the gradient moves predictably in the direction of a global minima. We would otherwise need more frequent recalculation of the gradient in a region to make sure we move in the right direciton.\n",

We want a decent amount of layers to learn a higher representation of features, e.g. not just frequency transitions but the shape and magnitude of these transitions with respect to one another. The gradient is usually high if a neuron is activated with ReLU, producing effective successive gradients in the network, while sigmoid and tanh activations produce near-zero gradients for very high magnitude inputs. All in all, ReLU will lead to much faster convergence and for this task produces excellent results.\n",

In contrast to the autoencoder, the components produced by PCA are linear combinations of the original data. This has the advantage of producing fast and interpretable transformations, but the disadvantage of being incapable of encoding nonlinear relationships between features. **In this sense, an autoencoder is sort of an upgraded PCA - it too can perform dimensionality reuidction, but with the added ability to learn nonlinear representations of features - at the sacrifice of interpretability and computational efficiency.\n",

        "Sparse autoencoders extend the constraints of encoding beyond number of hidden neurons - we may choose more hidden neurons than input data points, instead imposing the sparsity constraint, adding an extra penalty term to our loss function. We parameterize the penalty term with a sparsity parameter close to 0 for ReLU and sigmoid activations,  close to -1 for tanh: i.e. inactive. I'll refer to 0 as an inactive neuron herein. **The objective of sparse autoencoding is to force the average activation of all hidden neurons to be lower than the sparsity parameter: most neurons in the hidden layer will not activate for any given set of features.**\n",

        "The decoder layers of sparse autoencoders are trained with a loss function  - the \"reconstruction term\" - which optimizes the precise reconstruction of an input, usually with mean square (MSE) loss. Ultimately, the result is that unless a neuron's activation on a particular set of input features seriously blows up the loss for the resulting reconstruction, then that neuron will be parameterized to reduce its activation to 0 for that input. **A sparse autoencoder's neuron will only learn a high activation on an input feature set if it is critical to accuracy of the model.** As such, a model benefits from sparse autoencoding in that each neuron of the hidden layer activates if, and only if it is given as input the precise feature which it has learned to represent. This has the inherent benefit of harshly penalizing overfit models.\n",
